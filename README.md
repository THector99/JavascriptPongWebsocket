# PythonWebSocket Server Part
This is a little project that will connect multiple clients together via websockets. The ultimate goal is to make python clients that use the websocket to exchange information.
This information will be the position of the ball and the players bat to make a multiplayer Pong.

This part is the websocket/server part
see: https://github.com/THector99/PongClient  for the python clients.

# Example:
This websocket has been uploaded to heroku on the link: https://pwebsock.herokuapp.com/
here it is meant as a kinda crappy chat room, no names and all messages will be send to everyone who has been connected to the socket.
